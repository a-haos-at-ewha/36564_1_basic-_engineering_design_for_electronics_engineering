   <p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Creativity born of Chaos coupled Fate, finds loss unpredictably routine. This document outlines an implantation of wisdom born from every mother but until now, never realized by this son. Reading further, you will find an obvious truth, coupled to
    new technologies in a novel but until now, never realized convergence. If you my generous reader, take this proposal to heart and build true to description described, you will never lose the three most critical physical manifestations of life. Doors
    will always open for you, your personal data will always be at your fingertips, and channels of communication will never fail.</p>

   <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">Introduction</p>
   <p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Every child has asked their mother where a lost item is located. Every mother has told their love to try and remember where they last saw the missing item. This age old conundrum has existed since mothers have had children who’ve have had items of
    value. At some point during the evolution of child rearing, a simple truth was obtained; if you have items you need to live efficient, you need to keep these items from being lost. Woman, the clearly more sensible of the two genders, solved this problem
    long ago. But man, never known for sensibility eclipsing stubborn-inity; he has never been able to assimilate the catch-all purse. Thus, sons, brothers, and spouses have always been plagued by routine loss of items his partner gender always has at
    hand.

   </p>
   <p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The three most important material possessions one cannot leave home without can be described as; Access, Communication, and Coin. Access is gained through key rings. Communication is made with ubiquitous networked handhelds. Coin is kept in wraps holding
    bills and cards. Your keys; your phone; your wallet; these three items are physical manifestations of your person and leaving home for more than a quick excursion requires this trifecta of identification, connection, and data. Amazingly, and most
    likely due to hard- headed stubbornness, the yin gender male has almost one hundred percent failed to solve a problem that his yang gender female has had essentially one percent solution solved since the beginning of recorded history. This proposal
    is written with a whole and complete respect and love for the fairest of the sexes and belief that although a gentleman, for</p>
   <p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">whatever reason, cannot follow a ladies lead and carry a purse; he can follow direction, take a hint, and remember the words every mother has told there child. Put your things where they belong!</p>

     <p class="s2" style="display: inline;">Motivation</p>
     <p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I routinely lose my wallet, my keys, and my phone. I have lost my keys while looking for my phone which i lost while looking for my wallet which i lost looking for my keys which... As embarrassing as it is to admit, i am a loser. I am a card-carrying
      administrative member of the Confederation of International Airheads (CIA). My motivation is thus completely self- serving. I need to keep track of my Access, my Comm., and my Coin.</p>

     </p>
     <p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is nothing that is not in some way related to everything else. This is why items become lost. Mortal tracked Entropic matter is always trying to return to Chaos void. We know this is true because of the many systems, tools, and devices that
      have been imagined, developed, and created. Although there are countless examples a few common solutions you may already be familiar with are; the age-old catch-all; the long available whistle-to- find keychain; and the more recent tile BlueTooth
      object tracking device. Although all three of these items is a working solution, they all share one problem, they are not fool-proof. The first requires a person prone to forgetting to actively remember a routine. The second requires a person be
      able to utter a sound pattern that can easily be forgotten or incorrectly uttered. And the third requires that the person who loses item never lose an item required to locate a lost item! With this in mind, have a look at these three previous solutions
      and once you are familiar with their patterns of operation and methods of item tracking, you will understand the previous statement.</p>

It is expected to do this better by not allowing these items to be placed anywhere but one spot.</p>

      What may seem to be the most disturbing concern when it comes to completion of stated goals and worth noting for the proverial record; the team was allowed disbandation by Dr. Jewon Kang at the
      request of several members of the group. When this concern was presented to the writer of this document, he believed this solo-ization might be usefull for completion of the project as intended. This project is one of many that this author proposed
      to his team but more important to your understanding of what you are reading, this project is a long thought about and heavily mind experimented set of complications. Although the writer of the scribe you are reading was considerably surprised to
      hear of his team's desires to persue other goals, he was, and still is, very respecful of the anomoly that he presents and being of a nature implied implicitly in his surname; insistance of direction different then that Fated is typically abhorred.

      It was initially believe that due to the above describe situation, only portions of the above design would be able to be implemented. This massive change is on the ground situation naturally created considerbale concern for this author. This project is of seeminly critical importance to your scriber. Professionalsim be damned; ettiquite can take an exit. Documentation is a minor concern only made relavent by wishes to help others with similiar problems. Still in discussion with percieved 'management' this project's solo adminstrated actor has really only one goal; create a system that eliminates the time wasted searching for the three previously mentioned criticalities.

      So you just read a bit of what would be called forshadowing if we were describing non-fiction literary work. Obviously, you my scientifically minded reader noticed and may have even een surprised by this divergence from the the standard undergraduate project description you read. Having much respect for your intelect but also divining your bredth of ingested influence, you must have surmised that i am doing my best to keep your attention. There are several reasons for this playful manipulation of prose but the most important reason i am implementing such candor is very simple to say but requires a perceptive person such as yourself to fully understand. This project is one that implemented as envisioned, solves a problem mankind has been having for a very long time. Because i am scribing this up in HTML at the moment (hence the spelling errors and inabilty to add a foot-note) i should mention that the only reason i use the word 'mankind' is because, as i mentioned strongly in the abstract and introduction, Woman do not seem to have this problem at even a magnitude's division of a magnitude's division when compare to their conterpart gender.

      The relay switching should be pretty straight forward. The USB Keychain portion will be simplified to be a simple contact type switch. The NFC portion, being the most difficult and most likely to require
      tools and expertise not available at home, will be the first portion to be explored. The BlueTooth connection, although very much possible, will require a large amount of coding and may not be completed. Connection to the Amazon Echo device is unlikely
      but very much desired. The SmartCAR drink delivery portion of the device will most likely not be completed as the device is rather expensive and my wife would not approve of a robot delivering me coffee and/or beer.
